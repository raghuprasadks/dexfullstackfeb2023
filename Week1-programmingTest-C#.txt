1. Create an interface IBank having following
methods

int openAccount(string name,long mobile,string location)
Implementation class should create an account using randmon functionality and 
return the same
int deposit(int actno,int amttodeposit)
after deposit balance should be incremented.
Balance should be returned by this function

int withdraw (int actno,int amttowithdraw)
after withdraw balance should be decrementated.
Balance should be returned by this function

int checkBal (int actno)
Balance should be returned by this function


2. Create two implementation class
namely SBIBank and HDFCBank
they should implement IBank interface

3. SBIBank and HDFCBank are the child of Bank

4. Bank has methods called rateofInterest()
and simpleInterest(int prin,float roi,int time)
rateofinterest method should return the rate as a float
simpleInterest method should return the simple interest
after using the formulat i=prt/100

5. SBIBank and HDFCBank should override rateofInterest
method.

6. Create a BankTest class
to demonstate working of bank namely
opening an account,deposit,withdraw,checkbalance and finding
simpleInterest
